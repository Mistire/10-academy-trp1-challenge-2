# Submission: AI Content Generation Tool

This project implements a command-line tool for generating AI-driven media content, including music and video.

## Demo Video
- **YouTube**: [AI Artist Demo](https://youtu.be/rYPOx5sPzD0)

## Features Implemented

- **Music Generation**: Integration with Google Lyria for high-fidelity audio generation.
- **Video Generation**: Support for Google Veo and a custom-built Pollinations.ai provider for free, high-quality video clips (Wan 2.1/Seedance).
- **CLI improvements**: Fixed prompt/style requirements and aspect ratio handling.

## Final Status Note
> [!NOTE]
> All the video generating providers were not working during the final testing phase, so I have only uploaded the audio (music) generated by the tool. While the code for Veo, AIMLAPI, and Pollinations has been implemented and debugged, reliable generation was blocked by external API issues.

## Generated Content
The following audio files are available in the `exports/` directory:
- `lyria_20260202_131058.wav` (Generated with Google Lyria)
- `lyria_20260202_125953.wav`
- `lyria_20260202_130633.wav`

## Challenges Faced
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Video Generation Hurdles**: I encountered significant obstacles while setting up the video pipeline. Initial attempts with **Google Veo** were blocked by project quotas, and **AIMLAPI** required strict card verification. Even the **Hugging Face** fallback failed due to their serverless video API being discontinued (410 error)

## Technical Fixes
- **Lyria Audio Fix**: Resolved an issue where Lyria output was blank by adding the correct RIFF/WAV headers to the raw PCM data.
- **Veo SDK Compatibility**: Fixed attribute errors in the `google-genai` SDK usage for video generation.
- **Pollinations.ai Provider**: Implemented a keyless-friendly alternative using the Pollinations.ai API to bypass quota issues with other providers.
